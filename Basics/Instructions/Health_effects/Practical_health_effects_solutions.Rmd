## Assignment 3 - QALYs comparison  

- Which intervention provides the most QALYs?  
**Answer:** None

**Answer:** Based on the total number of QALY gained by each intervention, you should not have a preference because they provide the same number of QALYs (7 QALYs).  
- What if the quality of life with intervention A was 0.8, which one would you then prefer?  
**Answer:** If the quality of life with intervention A was increased to 0.8, then A would provide more QALYs, hence you should prefer it over B, when considering the total number of QALYs.
