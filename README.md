# Teaching
This repository aims at storing the codes I show during my teaching activities

The 'Distributions.Rmd' aims at showing students how to fit data using the `fitdistrplus` package, the methods of moments, and how to use the `rriskDistributions` package to fit distributions based on quantiles.
It futher shows how to use the [`flexsurv`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/flexsurv/flexsurv.pdf) package to fit parametric survival models using the `bc` dataset.
