# Teaching
This repository aims at storing the codes I show and use during my teaching activities.  

Under the 'Basics' folder, one can find different markdown documents and their outputs concerning different aspects of health economic evaluations such as:  
- "Distributions": show how to (assess the statistical) fit different distributions on individual-level data,  
- "Example_code": show different implementation of health state transition model in R,  
- "Probabilistic-analysis": contain an example of a probabilistic analysis,  
- "Advanced_topics": show how hyperparameters of parameter distributions can be varied in a individual-level simulation.
